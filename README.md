### [Project 1: Using Bayesian Statistics to find the Best Test XI](https://github.com/jkrishna12/Cricket_Bayesian_Average)
- Used requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape data from website and turn into a Pandas dataframe
- Cleaned dataframe removing missing/eroneous values
- Performed feature engineering to generate relevant data needed for analysis
- Implemented a bayesian analysis of a normal model with multiple observations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries used to create visualisation of data
- Arviz used to calculate the 90% HDI of the posterior distribution

### [Project 3: University Data Analysis](https://github.com/jkrishna12/University-Data-Analysis)
-	Analysed dataset using Pandas to find missing or erroneous data, replacing with appropriate values
-	Demonstrated skills in Seaborn and Matplotlib to show visualisations between key variables
-	Performed feature engineering to create relevant features for machine learning
-	Implemented and evaluated machine learning algorithms from Scikit-Learn to see which was most suitable for the business problem

### [Project 5: Statistical Football Models](https://github.com/jkrishna12/football_models)
- Used Pandas to manipulate Wyscout datasets to create relevant features for the statisitcal models
- Leveraged XGBoostClassifier and Linear Regression model to create an action based expected threat model
- Developed an expected goals model using logistic regression taking the angle and distance of a shot as features
